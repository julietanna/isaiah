    <h1>Indenture Contract</h1>
    <p>This document is an apprentice indenture, which is a legal contract that binds one person to another in an apprenticeship to learn a trade. Most indentures were in effect until the apprentice reached the age of 21 and was then considered a legal adult. The word indenture comes from the indents or curved cut line at the top of the document. As early as 1704 indentures in Boston were using pre-printed forms such as this one. Most of the rules and regulations of the contract are spelled out in the printed words. The names of the parties, the dates and some individualized terms of the deal were then added in handwriting.</p>
  <p>All indentures had two forms with the same wording. Both forms would be placed on top of one another and then cut at the top in a curved fashion; this would prove that both copies of the form belonged together, and were two identical versions of the same contract.</p> 
  <p>On this copy can be seen the signatures of the Overseers of the Poor, two Justices of the Peace and two additional witnesses. These signatures all signify that this is a legal binding contract. Zechariah Fowle’s copy does not have all of these names; however, it does have his own signature. Zechariah’s copy is now in the collections of the Boston Public Library. In 1756, it would have been stored in the files of the Overseers of the Poor.  Fowle held onto Isaiah’s copy as proof that the apprenticeship was valid and legal. On the back of this document is a hand written notation that Isaiah had completed his apprenticeship on January 8, 1769. While Thomas was not yet 21 years of age, Mr. Fowle agreed to end his apprenticeship at that time and gave this indenture to Thomas. When you ended your apprenticeship you “took up your indenture” that is you took it away from your master and it became your document, proving that you were a free and skilled laborer.</p>
  <p>Originally, this document would have also had paper seals affixed to it next to the signatures of the Overseers of the Poor. These seals signified that the document was official and had the sanction of the government officials.  At some point the document was cleaned by soaking it in distilled water. The paper seals likely came off the document with that cleaning.
     In addition to cleaning, this document was also repaired at some point in its history. The paper ripped along the fold lines and you can see the faint signs of the new paper fibers added as part of this repair work.</p> 
  <p>You can also see in the upper left hand corner a round embossed stamp. This stamp has the words “Massachusetts Stamp” around the edges and the words “II Pence” and an image of a codfish in the center. Pence is a British term for penny. The codfish is the official state fish and has been a symbol of Massachusetts for over 200 years. This stamp marked the two penny taxes paid to have this document drawn up, signed and filed with the town government.</p>
