  <div class="video-transcription">
    <p><em>(Pan into the portrait of Isaiah Thomas painted by Ethan Allen Greenwood. As the camera closes in on the face there is a crossfade to an actor dressed and posed as the painting. He then looks directly at the camera.)</em></p>
  
    <p>THOMAS: (He holds up the book in his hand and lovingly studies it) I collect books and all manner of printed materials. For I am a printer, a bookseller, and a stationer by trade. I clutch at examples of the printed word the way others grab at money and jewels. I have now in my possession some 3,000 books in addition to many volumes of newspapers, pamphlets, broadsides, and manuscripts.  I shall share a few with you now.  Some of these I created while others created me and all of them tell of this nation, the United States of America, and of the people, like myself, who created it.  (Taking the indenture in hand) This is an example of a document that created me.  (Close up of the Indenture) You'll note some of it is printed and some written out by hand. Pray tell what sort of document is this? It is a contract.  It is my indenture that bound me as a printer's apprentice to Zechariah Fowle.</p>

    <p><em>(Cut to the exterior of Fowle’s Printing Shop in Boston, 1756 Fidelity Thomas walks with young Isaiah passing a gentleman who bows to her. Fowle greets them and then ushers them into the door of his shop.)</em></p>

    <p>THOMAS <em>(in voice over)</em> I was placed in this apprenticeship because my mother could not afford to keep me. She put me in the care of Zechariah Fowle of Boston, a printer of cheap broadsides.</p>
  
    <p><em>(Cut to the interior of Isaiah Thomas’s Study in 1812.)</em></p>

    <p>THOMAS: I never knew my father; he went to Carolina and was never heard from again. My mother was left with five children to bring up without any means for her own or their support. I being the youngest, was apprenticed to Mr. F.</p>

    <p><em>(Cut to the interior of Fowle’s Printing Shop, 1756. Young Isaiah is sweeping with a broom. Fowle enters.)</em></p>

    <p>FOWLE: Isaiah, come here lad.</p> 

    <p><em>(Isaiah puts down the broom and walks to Fowle.)</em></p>

    <p>FOWLE: You see this lad it’s your indenture that binds you as my printer's devil. You will be my apprentice until you reach the age of 21.</p>  

    <p>ISAIAH: Does my mother know about this?</p>

    <p>FOWLE: Of course, your mother and I had the Overseers of the Poor draw it up.</p> 

    <p>ISAIAH: What does it say?</p>

    <p>FOWLE: Say? Well, it spells out what you can and can't do. Here for instance (Reading)"At cards, dice, or any other unlawful Game or games he - that is you - shall not play; taverns, ale-houses, or places of gaming he shall not haunt or frequent." You mind that lad.</p>

    <p>ISAIAH: I will, sir.</p>

    <p>FOWLE: And this, (Reading) From the service of his said Master by day or night he shall not absent himself; but in all things and at all times, he shall carry and behave himself toward his Master and all theirs as good and faithful apprentice out to do to his utmost ability during all the time or term aforesaid." You mind yourself now, this is a legal document.</p>

    <p>ISAIAH: Yes, sir.</p>

    <p>FOWLE: (Smiling) Ah but don't worry lad I'll teach you the mysteries of the trade. But now you go back to your broom and mind when you are done with that you empty the chamber pots for Mrs. F.</p>

    <p>ISAIAH: Will I go to school, like you promised?</p>

    <p><em>(Fowle grabs a hickory switch and threatens young ISAIAH with it.)</em></p>

    <p>FOWLE: Back to your broom and mind the pots or I'll give you a taste of this!</p>

    <p><em>(We see Young Isaiah sweeping in the distance. Dissolve to the interior of Isaiah Thomas’s study in 1812.)</em></p>

    <p>THOMAS: Despite, his promises to my mother to provide me a good education, Fowle's print shop was the only school I ever had.</p> 

    <p><em>(Cut to Fowle’s Printing Shop. Through a window we see Young Isaiah stand on a bench at the type cases. Then we see him inside as he picks up a sort and then studies a tattered book.)</em></p>

    <p>THOMAS (in voice over.): I learned to read and write by setting type and studying an ink- stained dictionary and a tattered Bible he kept on hand. Gradually, I came to understand that each sort, each piece of type, was vested with a transcendental power and potent with possibility.</p> 

    <p><em>(Close up of type in the composing stick . Young Isaiah adds the B to the word “Boston.”)</em></p> 

    <p>THOMAS: All my knowledge and the many books I would later create all came from these letters, taken up one at a time.</p>

    <p><em>(Cut to the interior of Thomas’s Study in 1812. Thomas is standing holding the indenture.</em></p>

    <p>THOMAS: My indenture was a very good thing, indeed!</p>
