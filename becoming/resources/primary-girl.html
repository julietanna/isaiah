		<p>Apprenticeship indentures were often entirely handwritten, as is the case with this one from 1761, which placed Hannah Child into an apprenticeship with Jonas and Hannah Brown of Sutton, Massachusetts. The indenture states that Hannah Child would live with the Browns from the age of 11 to 14, and while it does not specify that she would be trained in a particular trade, she would have learned what were deemed the proper duties of a colonial woman and housekeeper from Mrs. Brown. Likely young Hannah was placed in this apprenticeship by her guardian because she did not have another suitable home in which to live and learn these skills.</p>
