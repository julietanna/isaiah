		<p>Ironically, when Thomas was a master printer he turned again to the Overseers of the Poor, this time to secure an apprentice. In 1771, he signed an indenture with the Boston Overseers of the Poor for Anthony Haswell (1756-1816) to be his apprentice. This is the copy of the apprentice indenture that was kept in the records of the Overseers of the Poor.</p>
