		<p>This licentious ballad, entitled The Lawyer&rsquo;s Pedigree (1755), was the first thing that Isaiah Thomas typeset when he was just six years of age. Thomas wrote, &ldquo;I set the types which were double Pica, for this ballad in two days, tho&rsquo; I then knew only the letters, but had never been taught to put them together and spell.&rdquo;</p>
