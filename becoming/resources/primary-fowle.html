		<p>This is the Overseers of the Poor&rsquo;s copy of Isaiah Thomas&rsquo;s indenture. It contains Zechariah Fowle&rsquo;s signature but not that of the Overseers of the Poor. This copy was held on file in the records of the Overseers of the Poor. When the Overseers were disbanded in 1822, the Boston Public Library became the depository of their archives.</p>
