		<p>This is a blank printed indenture apprenticeship form from 1775. Because most of the terms of apprenticeships remained the same from one apprenticeship to another, they could be printed in advance. The form provides space to add in by hand the names of the apprentice and master and other details of the particular apprenticeship. The Boston Overseers of the Poor started using such pre-printed forms as early as 1704.</p>
