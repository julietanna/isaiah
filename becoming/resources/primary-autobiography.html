		<p>Isaiah Thomas wrote three autobiographical fragments that contain notes about his early years in Boston. The third part of these fragments provides a detailed account of Fowle’s printing business, in which Thomas refers to Fowle as a “ballad Printer, very ignorant as a man and as a Printer.”</p>
