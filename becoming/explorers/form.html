	<p>As early as 1704, indentures in Boston came in pre-printed forms such as this one. Most of the rules and regulations, which were the same for all apprenticeships, were spelled out in the printed words. The names of the parties, the dates, and some individualized terms of the deal were then added in handwriting.</p>
