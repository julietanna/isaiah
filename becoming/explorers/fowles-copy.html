	<p>This was Fowle&rsquo;s copy of the contract. It contains the signatures of the Overseers of the Poor, two Justices of the Peace, and two additional witnesses, signifying that all of these men witnessed and approved the signing of this legal, binding contract. Fowle signed the other copy, which belonged to the Overseers of the Poor and was filed in their records. That copy does not have all of these names; however, it does have Fowle&rsquo;s own signature. Fowle held onto Isaiah&rsquo;s copy as proof that the apprenticeship was valid and legal. </p>
