	<p>Here is a round embossed stamp with the words “Massachusetts Stamp” around the edges and the words “II Pence” and an image of a codfish in the center.  Pence is a British term for a penny. The codfish is the official state fish and has been a symbol of Massachusetts for over 200 years. This stamp marked the two-penny taxes paid to have this document drawn up, signed, and filed with the town government.</p>
