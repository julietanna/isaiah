	<p>Originally, this document would have had paper seals affixed to it with red wax.  These seals signified that the document was official and had the sanction of the government officials.  At some point the document was cleaned by soaking it in distilled water. The paper seals likely came off the document with that cleaning, leaving only the remnants of the red wax.</p>
