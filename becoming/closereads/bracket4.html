		<p>The rules that Isaiah must follow in his apprenticeship are similar to all apprenticeships in this time period. They provided guidelines for proper morality and socially acceptable behavior. They were also designed to protect the master economically. Because Isaiah was a minor, he was not considered legally responsible for any gambling debts he incurred, or any children he fathered, but his master was. If Isaiah did any of these things he would break his contract and his master would no longer be responsible for him. Fowle and his wife were essentially surrogate parents for young Isaiah. They provided him with an education, food, clothing, and a place to sleep, and they also guided him in the best way to behave.</p>
