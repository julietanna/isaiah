	<p>Thomas Flucker (1719-1783) remained loyal to the British Crown and was the last Royal Secretary of Massachusetts Bay, the third highest ranking Royal official. His daughter, Lucy (1756â€“1824), would marry Henry Knox (1750-1806), the American artillery officer who transported cannon from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston in the winter of 1776, which was used to drive the British out of Boston.</p>
