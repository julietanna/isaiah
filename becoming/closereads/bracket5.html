		<p>This document was a contract that benefited both parties. Fowle received a young worker he didnâ€™t have to pay to help him in his printing business. Isaiah got a home, food, clothing, and an education. He also learned the trade of printing, at which he could make money when he became an adult. It was a standard practice to provide apprentices at the conclusion of their apprenticeships with two sets of clothing, one to wear during the work week and another to be worn at church and on other special occasions.</p>
