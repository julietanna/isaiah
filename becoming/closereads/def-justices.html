  <h1 class="slimpop-title">His Majesty&rsquo;s Justices of the Peace</h1>
	
	<p>Justices of the Peace were people appointed by the government to exercise judicial power over local minor civil cases. They also had the power to carry out other legal civil processes, such as performing marriages and authorizing arrests. In 1756 Massachusetts was still a colony of Great Britain, and therefore Justices of the Peace were ultimately officials of &ldquo;His Majesty,&rdquo; the king.</p>
