  <h1 class="slimpop-title">Royall Tyler</h1>
	
	<p>Royall Tyler (1724-1771) was a wealthy merchant who was active in Boston politics. He was first elected to the Overseers of the Poor in 1755 and remained active in this role throughout the rest of his life. He was unpopular with the poor because he vigorously committed people to the Workhouse. His son, also named Royall Tyler (1757-1826), was the author of the first professionally produced play, <em>The Contrast,</em> which premiered in New York City in 1787.</p>
